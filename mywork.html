        <br><h3>Max/MSP: Movement-Based Audio Output</h3>
        <p>Fall 2022</p>
        <p><i>Yonsei University, CMP3210 - Music Technology</i></p>
        <p>The project combined music with computer vision by inputting webcam video and outputting midi values. Takes webcam input, mirrors it, converts it to greyscale, and creates a matrix from camera input. It finds the difference between each frame to find where motion is happening. There is a specific adjustable horizontal line in the matrix that you can use to detect motion from, then transmits the white line coordinates to the matrix to cut off everything above and below it. Then, it converts the matrix into numerical values for midi format and forms a filter that eliminates zero values. You can also change the instrument that outputs sound.</p>

        <h3>FIRST Robotics Competition</h3>
        <p><i>FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) is an international high school robotics competition. Each year, teams of high school students, coaches, and mentors work during a six-week period to build robots capable of competing in that year's game that weigh up to 125 pounds. Robots complete tasks such as scoring balls into goals, placing inner tubes onto racks, hanging on bars, and balancing robots on balance beams. The game, along with the required set of tasks, changes annually.</i></p>
        <br><p>2019 Season: Destination: Deep Space</p>
        <p><i>The game has an outer space theme involving two alliances consisting of three teams each competing to place poly-carbonate hatch panels and orange rubber balls or "cargo" on rockets and cargo ships before returning to their HAB platform to climb at the end of the match.</i></p>
        <p>Electrical Captain</p>
        <p>Team Awards: Channelview TX District Event Winner, Quality Award, Industrial Design Award, Woodie Flowers Award</p>
        <center><img src="/media/2019.jpg" style="width:200px;"></center>
        <br><p>2018 Season: FIRST Power Up</p>
        <p><i>The game has a retro 8-bit theme and teams are required to place milk crates, or "power cubes", on large balancing scales to tip the scale and gain ownership. Alliances can also trade power cubes for power ups, giving them a temporary advantage in a match. At the end of the match, robots can climb the tower attached to the centre balancing scale using a rung attached to the tower, giving them additional points.</i></p>

        <br><p>2017 Season: FIRST Steamworks</p>
        <p><i>The game has a steampunk theme and teams are required to shoot wiffle balls which represent fuel into a simulated boiler which transfers the generated steam into an airship in the middle of the field. Each alliance has one airship, which they pressurize with steam from the boiler and load with plastic gears from the field. At the end of the match, robots can climb and hang on ropes attached to the airship for additional points.</i></p>

        <br><p>2016 Season: FIRST Stronghold</p>
        <p><i>The game has a midieval theme and was played by two alliances of up to three teams each, and involves breaching the opponents’ defenses, known as outer work as well as capturing their tower by first firing "boulders" (small foam balls) at it, and then surrounding or scaling the tower using a singular rung on the tower wall. Points were scored by crossing elements of the tower's outer works, shooting boulders into the opposing tower's five goals in order to lower the tower strength, and by surrounding and scaling the tower.</i></p>

        <h3>FRC 5892 Logo Design and Branding/Media</h3>
        <p>In 2017, I took upon the task of rebranding my school's robotics team. I researched design and branding standards of other robotics teams across the country, and used this research to create our team's new logo and branding standards. I created shirts, hoodies, jerseys, stickers, and other merchandise for the team that upheld the standard I created. I also took the role of social media manager, running the team's twitter and instagram accounts while I was on the team.</p>

        <h3>Wearable Arduino Fashion</h3>
        <p>A light-up motion activated skirt that used Arduino Neopixel LED lights and an accelerometer to detect motion and would light up as you walk around. The lights are brighter if there is more movement, such as spinning or running. This skirt was the final project for my electronics class in my junior year and took about a month to complete, including hand-sewing each of the Neopixel lights into the skirt with conductive thread.</p>
        
        <br><h3>Other Arduino Projects</h3>
        <p>In my high school electronics class, I created many basic arduino projects. Some examples include temperature sensor, candle simulator, pressure sensor, etc.</p>

        <p>While I on my first trip in Japan, I decided to keep a travel diary since I would be there so long and keep track of everything I did. I have since digitalized (at least some of) it and recently uploaded the collages of the papers, receipts, junk, and other flat items I collected each day.

        <h3>1995 Mazda Miata</h3>
        <p>My car, my pride and joy. I have owned the car for over 3 years, and I complete all upgrades and repairs by myself. I often go driving for fun, and my car has been amazing every time. This car has gotten me through many ups and downs in the last 3 years and I can't be more thankful to her. Although it may be old, I believe that if you take care of a car, it will take care of you.</p>

        <h3>VTuber Model</h3>
        <p>During Covid, I was interested in streaming on Twitch and I thought it would be funny to turn myself into a vtuber. I used Vroid Studio to create the model and through webcam tracking I used it sometimes during my Twitch streams. I was on my school's Valorant competitive team at the time, so I would stream some of my games for my friends and in the corner would be my little avatar. Later, when I moved to Austin, I got a VR setup and started to play VR games with the Vtuber setup too.</p>
        <p>The model is pretty simple, because Vroid Studio wasn't very complex at the time when I created it. It just looks like me when I had dyed my hair green during Covid with a simple tshirt and jeans. I would usually only position the model to appear from the waist-up in streams since the bottom half wasn't doing anything interesting if I wasn't playing a VR game.</p>
        <p>I think it would be fun to get back into vtubing or making vtuber models, but the vtuber market has gotten totally oversaturated in the last year or two. And, I did this partly as a joke, so I don't think I would seriously try doing it again to gain followers or make money.</p>

        <h3>Olympus Pen EE-3</h3>
        <p><i>Film stocks used: Kodak Gold 200, Kodak Ultramax 400</i></p>
        <p>My first film camera. Bought November 22, 2022 at the film camera market in Chungmuro, Seoul for ₩175,000. The Olympus Pen series cameras take half-frame photos, meaning I can get double the photos out of a roll of film, good because film is getting expensive nowadays. Since the photos are taken on half frame, the camera takes photos vertically by default. This camera is special because it features an engraving of the previous owner's name on it, HAN. I like to think that cameras like this have a soul and carry the memories of its past life. I wonder what kind of person the owner was and what kind of photos they took.</p>

        <h3>Minolta Pocket Autopak 450 Ex</h3>
        <p><i>Film stocks used: Lomography LomoChrome Purple, Lomography Lobster Redscale</i></p>
        <p>My second film camera. Bought February 18, 2023 at a thrift store in Maebashi, Gunma, Japan for ¥880. It takes 110 film and also features the previous owner's name, 大田. I have only used weird film stocks with this camera, so the photos are all experimental and many didn't turn out well. Since 110 film is discontinued by almost every company except Lomography, it is hard to find film for this camera and I haven't taken many photos with it.</p>

        <h3>Minolta Hi-matic SD</h3>
        <p><i>Film stocks used: Fujifilm 200</i></p>
        <p>My third film camera. Technically I bought it for my friend back home, but i'm using and testing it until I return home. Bought March 27, 2023 at the film camera market in Chungmuro, Seoul for ₩200,000. This camera is relatively high-tech, featuring a pop-up flash, automatic timer, automatic exposre adjustment, and the ability to set the date (although the only years available are 1982 through 1992).</p>

        <h3>Filmlog Disposable</h3>
        <p>Technically, this was my first film camera. I bought it at the vending machine at FilmLog in Dongdaemun for ₩30,000 when I first got to Korea to document some of my travels. When I bought it, I didn't realize that it was black & white film, so I was devastated when I developed the photos and they came back colorless. I took many colorful photos with this camera only for them to turn out grey lol.</p>
